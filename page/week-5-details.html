                            <p>Task: Design a version of the Echo Hello World Board with at least a button and LED</p>
                            <p> For this weeks assignment I decided I wanted to design a PCB for my final project. This
                                PCB will act as the audio display for music and will sit on the dashboard of the ATV.

                                Before I started I had to figure out what components I want to use. I first started with
                                the MCU (MicroController); I picked the ATiny1614 this MCU has 20hz clock and can be
                                powered with either 3.3V or 5V supply. Next I chose the OLED screen, I found a standard
                                <a
                                    href="https://www.amazon.com/PEMENOL-Display-0-96inch-Raspberry-Microcontroller/dp/B07F3KY8NF">0.96inch
                                    SSD1306 OLED</a> in the lab which Anthony was kind enough to give me. Next I needed
                                to configure a Serial Output port and a Programming port. Reading the datasheet for the
                                ATtiny1614 I found that I can program the board through UPDI and read Serial via a
                                standard serial port. Since UPDI is just serial with RX and TX tied together to
                                program all I need is a USB to serial programmer which we have at the EDS lab. Utilizing
                                this information I was able to design a schematic. I added a small button which can be
                                configured to do something later.

                <h3 class="resume-title">Routing the Traces and Milling the Board</h3>
                <div class="resume-item pb-0">
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col">
                            <p>
                                After laying out the schematic and checking all the pins I began routing the traces.
                                Before I started I set the constraints of our machine into my design, from a couple of
                                weeks ago this was found to be 16 mil trace clearance and width. Once the design rules
                                were set I was able to start routing traces.
                                This was fairly annoying, at first I tried to do it with as little 0 Ohm jumpers as
                                possible. However, I soon realized how futile this is and embraced the jumpers. I ended
                                up with only 2 jumpers. I added a ground pour which is nice cause all the grounds would
                                be connected and I end up with less to mill out.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Once I routed all the traces I ran it through the DRC (Design Rules Checker ) to check
                                everything was within the constraints. The results came back with no significant errors
                                (had 3 for the jumpers). Then I generated the gerber files and sent it to the mill to be
                                milled out. The results were great I didn't even need to sand the board like last time.
                                I used 1/64" PCB conservative, 1/32" flat end mill, and 1/8" flat end mill to mill out
                                the board.

                                I'm glad to say that I really learned my lesson from last time. I was patient and waited
                                for a proper station to open up and used flux with only a tiny amount of solder. This
                                time around my soldering came out quite well. However, my nice soldering job was soon
                                overshadowed by a few shorts on my board. I removed the components from my board only to
                                realize it actually wasn't my soldering it was just a tiny piece of copper left over
                                from the mill. Something that I would have caught if I sanded the board. Lesson learned
                                again.

                                Now for the real test. To prove that my design met the bare minimum of success. I needed
                                to program it with the Echo Hello World ino <a
                                    href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/embedded_programming/t1614/hello.t1614.echo.ino">file</a>.
                                To this I first configured my Arduino IDE to be able program the ATtiny MCUs. I followed
                                the instructions laid out by our well versed TA Anthony. First I opened up my Arduino
                                IDE and went to <i>File > Preferences > Additional Board Managers</i> and added this
                                link <a href="http://drazzy.com/package_drazzy.com_index.json">
                                    http://drazzy.com/package_drazzy.com_index.json </a>. Then I went to <i>Tools >
                                    Board > Boards Manager</i> and Typed ATtinyCore and downloaded the manager by
                                SpenceKonde. Then I reloaded my IDE and went to <i> Tools </i> and selected my board and
                                chip which is the ATTiny1614. I also selected the Programmer to be "Serial UPDI - SLOW".
                                After configuring the IDE and connecting my board though the UPDI port. I compiled and
                                uploaded the echo sketch successfully. Then I plugged the programmer into the FTDI port
                                on my board and was able to send and receive responses. Finally, my board works.

                                After having a successful initial test I was feeling confident enough to push my board
                                to the limit and see if everything is working. So I wrote my custom firmware to change
                                the OLED screen to black when the button is pressed and white otherwise. Small
                                disclaimer I downloaded the Adafruit GFX and SSD1306 Arduino Libraries (<i>Tools > Manage Libraries</i>). And Since the
                                pins I used for I2C were hardware I2C I just needed to compile the code and upload.
