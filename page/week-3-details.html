                                For our group assignment this week we had to get the design constraints of our mill. The
                                reason we have to do this is because we need to see what the minimum trace size and
                                clearance has to be in order for us to mill out our PCBs. We started by making a test
                                PCB that has varying trace sizes and clearances and lets us identify the proper
                                constraints for our Programmer PCB and future PCBs. We found that our traces and minimum
                                clearance should be 16 mill with a 1/64" endmill. Anything below this could be done but
                                would require a different drill bit.

                                The first step in making any PCB on the mill is we need to generate our gerber board
                                files. To do this I took the png images from the cba website (
                                <a
                                    href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/embedded_programming/SWD/hello.CMSIS-DAP.10.D11C.traces.png">here</a>

                                and ran it through KiCAD 6.0's image converter. The image converter outputs a text file
                                that you can modify to make into a footprint on any layer (<a

                                details on the process). Once you modified the proper file you should be left with a
                                foot print you can import into KiCAD.

                            <p>
                                To mill out this PCB I used the Bantom mill in EDS. This mill is really good for
                                prototyping, however it has some limits. The software that comes with the mill only
                                allows you to change the toolhead 3 times. So if your project requires a wide variety of
                                bits, or you just want to save speed (1/64, 1/32, 1/100, 1/8), like I do for this
                                programmer, then you have to do some clever workarounds. First when I inputted my board
                                (which neal gave us) I
                                saw a lot of red which means you need to change the toolhead to mill it. After I changed
                                the toolhead to 1/64 the red was still there. So then I did what any sane person would
                                do I lied to the computer and told it that I had the 1/100" toolhead, when in fact it
                                did
                                not. However, now I had another problem the computer was telling me It would take an
                                hour to mill out all the traces. To get around this I had it go through the first part
                                of the job with the 1/64" and 1/100" (actually 1/64") bit then canceled the job and then
                                restarted the file by telling the software to cut the 1/8" and 1/32" traces.

                                Unfortunately all the time I saved milling was immediately spent soldering. I was
                                waiting a long time for a Soldering station to open in EDS so I decided to take one of
                                the bigger irons and some leaded solder and go at it by hand. It took about 45 minutes
                                however I didn't do the greatest job. Next time I'll use solder paste/flux. After I got
                                the
                                soldering done I checked for shorts with a multimeter. I corrected the only short I
                                found by using the solder suction. Then, I was left with a nice finished PCB.

                                This was the fun part seeing if it worked. To make my piece of copper a board I needed
                                to program in the firmware to the microcontroller. To do this we needed to find a
                                programmer compatible with our board type. We ended up using the Atmel CMSIS Programmer.
                                I plugged it in the SWD input on my board then ran edgb on my machine and I turned my
                                copper into a programmer. Then to test it I used my board to program another board, and
                                it worked.
