                <div class="resume-item pb-0">
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col">
                            <p>
                                The start of any good project begins with the design. Because I needed to make something
                                that had to be routed out of a thin sheet of plywood, I had to keep my design simple and
                                able to fit within the dimensions of the sheet. However, since I do not have the mind of
                                a super computer and cannot compute the tiling optimization in my head, to see if my 3D
                                assembly of
                                parts will fit within the sheet dimensions, I decided to make this the most
                                parameterized Tressure chest known to man. I used SolidWorks to make the CAD
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Believe it or not even something as simple as
                                a box is very annoying when making a parameterized assembly. The first thing I did to
                                make this assembly parameterized was make an assembly sketch. This sketch is used as a
                                base to mate parts to and use as a reference. This sketch is defined by my main
                                parameters (height, depth, width), which in turn defines the placement and size of each
                                component in the assembly. The cool thing about doing this method is that I don't need
                                to define the base sketches of components I can just tie the base sketch to the main
                                assembly sketch via the constraint solver. Basically I am designing from the top down
                                instead of the
                                down up. In anycase, this method proved quite effective and resulted in a very
                                parameterized design.

                                For this part I just followed Anthony's instructions. I started by exporting my
                                SolidWorks project as a STEP file, then uploading it into Fusion 360. Once I had my
                                assembly in Fusion I opened the Manufacturing Workspace and made a new manufacturing
                                model and arranged the parts on flat plane of size 47.5" by 47.5" with a spacing of
                                0.4". After arranging the model I began a new milling setup and put the stock size and
                                home position relative to my parts. Next I selected a 2D contour cutting operation and
                                put the speeds and
                                feeds for the Mill at EDS (3/8" Flat end Mill, 12000 RPM, cutting rate of 100 in/min,
                                and plunge rate of 40 in/min). Next I selected all the contours I wanted to cut out.
                                Then manually place the tabs along the contour. This process largely went smoothly it
                                just took quite some time. After that was done I generated my toolpath and everything
                                looked good so I ran it through post processer and made my tab file. Then I sent to the
                                mill and milled it out.

                                For this part I began by crowbarring my pieces off the mill bed, then I used the bandsaw
                                and oscillating saw to remove the tabs. I then moved all the components to my car and
                                took it to D-Lab. Where I will sand and stain and assemble my wood.

                                So after milling I found that my parts didn't fit, each surface was offset by roughly 50
                                thousandths of inch. In order to fix this I sanded down all the surface and applied glue
                                to keep the assembly together. I then added finishing nails along the accent pieces
                                (dark pieces in the assembly) to give it that rustic tressure chest vibe. Once
                                everything was put together. I did some scavenging and found a handle, hinges, and chest
                                locks. I created pilot holes for all the additions (#8 for the handles and hinges and #6
                                for the locks). For the sanding I went from 80 grit to 240 grit to get the finish you
                                see.

                                Once I had the cover and main body fully assembled and sanded. I went to the fume hood
                                and began staining the wood. For the interior I used a natural stain and for the
                                exterior I did a combination of dark stain and light red cedar stain. I used the dark on
                                the accent pieces and cedar on the main panels, however there was a lot of cross
                                contamination. After I stained the wood I left it to dry for a while and then came back
                                to put everything together one last time.
