                                For this week I wanted to make my own audio amplification board, that interfaced
                                directly with my main board from last week. I wanted to be able to push at least 2W
                                through an 8 Ohm speaker. I also wanted to use the LM386 cause it was very easy to use
                                and past experience with LM4781 has shown to be very annoying. After reading the
                                <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/gpn/lm386">datasheet </a> and discovering something
                                called a bridged amplifier configuration, I came up with my own schematic for a very
                                loud (for an LM386) audio amplifier.

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col">
                            <p>
                                So to simplify this explanation and make it more clear I will only focus on one unit of
                                it (half of the bridge configuration). All the bridge configuration means is that the
                                input signal gets inverted by sending it to the inverting input of the lm386 and then
                                added to the amplification by adding the output to the negative side of the speaker.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So the first thing to know about using the LM386 amplifier is that it is very sensitive
                                to noise. This is why you need to be very careful of how you place bypass capacitors. I
                                went with the overkill solution of bypass caps and put 3 on each IC (CA_3, CA_8, CA_9)
                                each of different values. Next I made sure to add another capacitor between the grounded
                                input and the actual ground rail (pins 2 and 4). This may seem like it does nothing but
                                it acts as a
                                means to prevent radio frequencies from interfering with the IC (which is why its in the
                                pico farad range). Next is the bypass cap for pin 7, this comes from the datasheet. It
                                is there to stabilize amplification circuitry in the chip. Next we have bass boost (pins
                                1 to 5), this makes the audio output sound very very nice. finally, we have two output
                                filters a lowpass filter and a highpass filter.

                                Before making this on an actual PCB, I decided to test my circuitry on a breadboard.
                                This helped me visualize whats happening and also see what the audio would sound like
                                and if I could improve it somehow. This was a very good idea, I found the source of a
                                lot of noise and plugged it with capacitors and other things. This allowed me to refine
                                my design and use better values for my capacitors and resistors.

                                I wanted the board to fit in a small area and interface with the board from last week. I
                                made it 50 mm by 50 mm. It takes 3 inputs (power, ground, and audio input), see last
                                weeks documentation for more detail on this. I used big thick traces and made everything
                                easy to solder. I routed my traces and created the footprint.

                                After routing my traces I milled out my board. This was very annoying! The initial board
                                after it came out of the mill had a lot of problems, that I couldn't see. It was only
                                after soldering all the components and finding short after short then removing the
                                components, did I realize that the mill really messed up and left a bunch of small
                                copper jumpers all over my board that I did not see. I resoldered the whole thing twice
                                and still found out that there was another short between the audio input and ground.
                                After trying to fix the issue and all the resoldering I decided to scrap the board. Meet
                                the requirement this week by using the breadboard amplifier.
