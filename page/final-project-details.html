                            This project started as an idea Me and Raiphy had over the summer. After a pretty tough
                            Junior Spring, I wanted to do something big. All of my friends said it couldn't be done they
                            called us crazy,
                            even Anthony had his doubts. I wanted to leave it all out on the field,
                            showing not only myself but people in general what can be accomplished with a little grit
                            and technical knowledge. With that in mind I present Oliya: an Electric ATV project, the
                            greatest senior fall project MIT has ever seen.

                                All of my friends make their own electric vehicles. Some make skateboards, some make
                                bikes, but none have gone as far as making an off-roading, fully fledged, four wheeled
                                vehicle with suspension. That is what I aim to do. Oliya will be a fully working
                                electric ATV. Modeled after the Tesla cyberquad, Oliya features a steal frame made with
                                recycled box tubing. Equipped with a 10 KW 3-phase brushless motor, Oliya will have the
                                equivalent of a 200cc engine, making it a powerful contender against modern gas powered
                                ATVs. Oliya will have 4 shock absorbers (rated for 2250+ ibs), giving even the heaviest
                                rider a smooth ride. It will have two independent front suspension arms and one rear
                                suspension arms. The total weight of the vehicle will be roughly 250 ibs making it ideal
                                for speed and power applications.
                            </p>

                                Oliya is composed of 4 main assemblies: the vehicle frame, front suspension, rear
                                suspension, and steering mechanism. The vehicle frame is made out of steal box tubing
                                from recycled desks it is designed to support up two riders, and sustain forces from
                                difficult terrain. The front suspension is modeled after double wishbone suspension, it
                                has an upper and lower arm attached to the front wheel hubs. The front shock absorber is
                                connected to the lower arm, similar to wishbone suspension. However, Oliya's front
                                suspension is specifically designed for manufacturing. The rear suspension assembly will
                                also include Oliya's power train. The motor and chain assembly will be connected to the
                                rear axle all under the rear suspension assembly, which will be supported by two shock
                                absorbers. Finally, the steering will be modeled after bike steering, featuring
                                motorcycle handle bars and connected to the front wheel hub through ball and socket
                                joints. The handle bars give a user extra torque for turning, removing the need of power
                                steering.

                                This frame was sorta loosly modeled after the <a
                                    href="http://better-magazine.com/tesla-cyberquad-replica-rips-past-100-mph-with-diy-electric-powertrain/">
                                    Tesla Cyberquad </a>. I Designed it with high
                                impact forces on the front and rear shock absorbers in mind. So lots of triangles in
                                those
                                areas. I also wanted it to be safe for me and Raiphy since neither of us had ridden an
                                ATV
                                before so I designed it with a lot of strength in the front. Lastly, I also took into
                                account the size of the battery which is why we have a large open area in the middle
                                where
                                the battery is going to go. Since I am not a Mechanical Engineer and have never really
                                done
                                any heavy machinery or a CAD of this magnitude, I over-engineered this frame. This is
                                just
                                meant to be a prototype and just show people that just with a computer and some hard
                                work, you
                                can build anything.

                                For the front suspension, I modeled it after double wishbone suspension. Double wishbone
                                is
                                good cause it is easy to make compared to other suspensions and provides good stability.
                                It
                                is also really easy to mount to a vehicle frame it just requires to 3 mounting points
                                all a
                                fixed distance a part. It is also easy to work out the loads that different parts will
                                be
                                subjected to which allows more optimized lightweight parts to be designed. Which makes
                                it
                                perfect for our vehicle since we are using thinner steel tubing.

                                For the rear suspension, I had to take quite a few things into account. First the
                                electric
                                powertrain; since the frame was going to have the battery and seat, and since the rear
                                axle
                                would move with respect to the frame, I decided to put the powertrain onto the rear
                                suspension arm. This comes at the cost of making the rear suspension more complicated.
                                However, it also makes the powertrain less complicated as I wouldn't require a two stage
                                reduction to get to drive the rear axle. Its also worth noting that the placement of the
                                motor was designed close to the pivot of the rear suspension. This is to limit the
                                rotational inertia of the rear suspension, which in turn would reduce its torque on the
                                mount and force on the rear shocks. In anycase, I designed the rear suspension to be
                                easy to weld (for the most part) and easy to manufacture, having only trivial planar
                                to cut. With all this in mind I came up with a very decent CAD for the Rear Suspension,
                                with the exception of the Motor Mount Plate, designed and machined by <a

                                After redesigning the Rear Suspension Assembly (See weeks 12/14 and 12/19 in
                                implementation below for more details), the new Rear Suspension adds another gear
                                reduction. This new design increases our torque and lowers our top speed. This is
                                exactly what we want because we are limited in Max RPM of the motor by the motor
                                controller. Before our gear ratio was 9T to 37T which means we have ~4 times as much
                                torque that the motor can output. However with the new ratio we have 9T to 24T then a
                                10T to 37T, resulting in a total 1:7.45 gear ratio. This is enough for a top speed of 15
                                mph given our motor and controller and enough torque for our purposes.

                                    here</a>) which I decided to buy and CAD around. This steering assembly will give us
                                Akkerman-steering geometry, which is basically where the wheel turns according to its
                                turning radius. So the left wheel turns more left during a left turn and the right wheel
                                turns more right during a right turn.

                            Due to the scale of this project many things had to be improvised and designed flexibly. As
                            you
                            will see with many things in our implementation did not match to the CAD. The CAD here
                            serves as
                            more of a guideline than a rule and is simply meant to give our implantation some structure
                            to
                            follow. That being said many elements of our frame and suspension assemblies match the cads
                            almost exactly.

                            Its very hard for me to convey the level of work we did in sum. Me and Raiphy easily put in
                            30+ hours each week (some weeks 80-90 hours), in addition to maintaining our schedules for
                            class and completing our
                            other weekly assignments. Each week was a new challenge not only mentally but also
                            physically, towards the end it took almost my entire being to muster up the energy and
                            strength to finish. For each week I took progress photos (shown below). The best way I
                            thought to
                            convey what we did each week was with a timeline and small description. Also to better focus
                            the multiple parts of this project, I will highlight some of the designs I made for this
                            project that I think exemplify each technique I learned in class.

                                    We began this week by breaking down the recycled desks and compiling them into piles
                                    of
                                    stock tubing. We did this by using an angle grinder and cut-off wheel, the whole
                                    process
                                    took several hours. Next we found a place to work and build our ATV, D-Lab. we
                                    talked
                                    with Dan, the acting shop head, he liked the project and got us started right away.
                                    Me
                                    and Raiphy both received welding training, on the MIG welder, and began welding our
                                    frame according to the
                                    CAD. This was my first time welding, so forgive me on some of the trash welds. We
                                    were
                                    also given access to a cold-saw which is exceptional at cutting our tubing at
                                    perfect
                                    angles. It is worth noting that for each weld we had to clear the paint off each
                                    peice
                                    of tubing this took about 20 mins for each piece of tubing.

                                    For this week we continued to work on the frame. Each day cutting our stock and
                                    shaping
                                    it into pieces for the frame. I devised a way to keep track of which things needed
                                    to be
                                    cut and assembled for each frame. I came up with a google spreadsheet and broke each
                                    weld/weld group into categories. I labelled them in the CAD so both me and Raiphy
                                    could
                                    see and work on them independently. In hindsight this was an important and very
                                    beneficial step. It helped track progress and made things easier to work on. This

                                    This week we continued our work on the frame completing weld group 5, 6, and 7.
                                    These
                                    took a long
                                    time because it had awkward angles and was quite long so it took a while to get rid
                                    of
                                    the paint. We also started cutting and shaping tubing for the 6 and 7th weld group.
                                    From
                                    this point forward when referencing cutting I am referring to a rough cut made with
                                    the
                                    cold saw for both length and general angle of each tube end. Similarly, when talking
                                    about shaping I am referring to the process of removing paint and cleaning up the
                                    edges
                                    of each tub with a file, preparing it to be MIG welded.

                                    sections of our frame. We began working on the bridges. The bridges add more
                                    rigidity to
                                    the frame. Bridges are single pieces of tubing that connect between weld groups.
                                    This is
                                    in contrast to the weld groups which make continuous connections.

                                    Upon further inspection of our frame closer to where our suspension mounts we
                                    decided it
                                    would be best if we reinforced the area with solid round tubing we found in D-Lab.
                                    Raiphy did most of the work for this. While I worked on other weld groups. This was
                                    one
                                    of our more gruelling tasks it required a lot of effort. Hats off to Raiphy for
                                    doing
                                    this. I worked on cutting and shaping more bridges for adding to our frame.

                                    For this week we completed our frame. We managed to hustle and get the Frame fully
                                    complete it weighed in at about 50 ibs (~25kg). Later in the week we divided up the

                                    tasks, and decided to set a goal of having a rolling ATV assembly by Thanksgiving.
                                    Raiphy was in charge of assembling the front suspension arms and I will be in charge
                                    of
                                    assembling the rear suspension arms, which contained more welds.

                                    Because I wanted more welding practice, I decided to cut, shape, and weld this
                                    assembly
                                    myself. For the first part of the week I spent each day cutting and shaping each

                                    of tubing to almost the exact specifications in the CAD. I was able to compete

                                    all the welds for the rear suspension arm.

                                    The main thing I did this week, while Raiphy worked on the front suspension, was
                                    continue my work on the Audio amplifier from week 7. I want to be able to drive this
                                    ATV
                                    and play music. I managed to do some testing on a breadboard and settled on a
                                    configuration for the Audio Amplifier I liked. using 2 LM386's and some filters with
                                    feedback I was able to make a bridged configuration that seemed to outperform the
                                    LM4781
                                    Audio Amplifier IC. I also water-jetted our suspension arm mounts.

                                    The highlight of this week was Raiphy completing the front suspension arm main
                                    bodies.
                                    we still needed to add stuff for each the rear and front however we were at a point
                                    were
                                    welding based on the CAD deviated too much from real life. So we decided to wait
                                    until
                                    we were ready to assemble the rolling chasis before finished off the welds. Also at
                                    this
                                    point me and Raiphy were extremely comfortable working with Steal and MIG welding,

                                    In order to meet our deadline we needed to assemble our rolling Chasis. For this we
                                    needed threaded rods I made a trip to home-depot and got 1/2" threaded rods with
                                    appropriate nuts. I also purchased some small nuts and any other things we might
                                    need.
                                    We spent alost each day of the week at shop. We finished off any welds we needed for
                                    the
                                    Rear and Front Suspension arms. We hustled and worked late into the evening, we
                                    managed
                                    to assemble our chasis and it rolled. We met our first deadline.

                                    After meeting our first deadline, I felt reassured on the trajectory of the project,
                                    gaining even more confidence that week we would indeed meet our goals. For this week
                                    I
                                    played around with CAN, exploring whether it would be feasible to integrate all the
                                    circuitry into a CAN-bus. This was largely successful (see week <a
                                        href="./week-11-details.html">11</a> and <a

                                    also started work on assembling
                                    our steering. I managed to water-jet a plate that gets welded to the frame in front.
                                    Again this was designed in a very simple so as to not take too much time to
                                    assemble.

                                    This is where things are starting to get super improvised. For this week I started
                                    by
                                    finding a steering handle. I was able to find a handle bar and the mount to along
                                    with
                                    it from a recycled barbie bike. I took the mount to the sand-blaster to remove the
                                    pink
                                    paint from it, for later welding. I did the same with the handle bar however it was
                                    taking too long so I stopped. After sand blasting I did some machining on the lathe
                                    to
                                    get the steering attachment that came with the go-kart steering to fit into the
                                    bearing.
                                    Then I started mounting it too the frame. At the same time Raiphy began to integrate
                                    the
                                    battery and Motor Controller.

                                <p>
                                    This week had the biggest highs and the biggest lows. Once we got it finally moving
                                    we
                                    discovered several nearly fatal issues. First I learned the hard way that if there
                                    are
                                    aren't enough constraints to match the degrees of freedom something breaks, if
                                    something
                                    is used in an unintended way it breaks, and finally always do your math before you
                                    make it. With that in mind I can explain what happened during this week.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    First we discovered that our steering was not able to handle the forces on it due to
                                    the weight of the vehicle and the torque applied by the handle bars. These forces
                                    caused the pinion gear, in the rack and pinion assembly, from the steering assembly
                                    to come off. This then caused the front tires to lock out become and misaligned
                                    the handle bars. So straight on bars no longer became straight on the road.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The next problem we discovered was that we didn't have enough torque to drive the
                                    ATV through a turn (when the steering was working) or go around on the road. This
                                    was seemingly a fatal problem as the only solution was to redesign the transmission,
                                    and somehow machine it to fit on the current assembly, an almost impossible task.

                                    At this point all hope seemed lost, however after a pick me up from my brother,
                                    Raiphy
                                    Jerez. I mustered up some energy and looked at the CAD for the transmission, after
                                    staring at it for a while I came up with a solution, it would be a pain to assemble
                                    but
                                    it would work. I came up with a way to mount another reduction stage, by taking
                                    advantage of our current motor plate which had been welded, in our Raiphy worked on
                                    solving the steering problem. He delivered spectacularly. We were able to work
                                    together
                                    and fixed minor issues that came up with either of our solutions. Within 48 hours
                                    our
                                    project went from barely drivable to smooth riding.

                                <p>
                                    Once we go through this hurdle it was time to integrate our main Electronics
                                    additions we had been working on over the weeks. I redesigned my speaker boards from
                                    the previous weeks to be more modular and robust. I made an amplifier board for each
                                    speaker and an input board which handles volume and aux input as well as a mixing
                                    channel for the wave-form display. I milled out the boards designed a case for the
                                    speaker and panel for all of Raiphy's additions. We managed to integrate everything
                                    with the exception of the wave form display.

                                        This is the final state of our project we did so much work. This is a video of
                                        me
                                        taking a stationary joyride and listening to music. This is beyond what I could
                                        have ever
                                        imagined when I set out for my journey at MIT. Doing projects like this, I learn

                                        just a lot about the world around me, but also about myself. I learn what I am
                                        capable of when I set mind to do something and what I can do under pressure.

                                    This first 2D Design is a sprocket. This is the part I am most proud of on our ATV
                                    it
                                    has been very reliable and is crucial to the functioning of our vehicle. It is also
                                    my
                                    most parametric CAD all a user has to do is input a few details about the chain such
                                    as
                                    pitch and select a number of teeth and SolidWorks will spit out a CAD for your
                                    sprockets. This can be used with multiple types of chains and fits perfectly for our
                                    chain which is #50 chain.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    After making this CAD, I used a small section of our 3/8" steal sheet given to me by
                                    D-Lab, and took to the water-jet. I loaded it into the water-jet and set the path
                                    and
                                    watch OMAX do all the work for me. After machining it, we needed a slight chamfer
                                    along
                                    the edges of the teeth so it would grip the chain properly. So I sanded the sprocket
                                    down on a belt sander. After that we hammered it into the motor shaft.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In total I machined 3 Sprockets a 10T, 24T, and 9T. 9T and 24T for the first
                                    reduction
                                    and 10T for the second reduction.

                                    Another Notable 2D design is the Dashboard Mount. This Design is for all the things
                                    we want in our dashboard (e-stop, signal and headlight switches, volume and audio
                                    input). The impressive thing about this design was that it was guessed correctly the
                                    first time and I required no iteration in my design. What is on the ATV now is the
                                    first time I manufactured it. It was designed to be integrated with the MCP screen
                                    from my input devices week. And switches we found lying around. There are also
                                    mounts for the speaker enclosure.

                                    Speakers it was made to be as a large as
                                    possible, to get a flatter frequency response curve without interfering with other
                                    sections of our ATV like the battery. I printed it with White ABS.

                                    It was fairly straight forward to design and assemble. I designed in tolerance for
                                    the screws to screw into the ABS plastic. This is not usually a good Idea. But in
                                    this case the Assembly just needed to last a couple of days.

                                    Following my progress from the previous weeks I milled out two new versions of audio
                                    amplifiers from the output devices week. The amplifier board (on the right) has a
                                    larger
                                    ground plane which should help with some noise and it also adds more gain (because I
                                    have more powerful speakers). This should allow the max volume set by the
                                    potentiometer
                                    to be very high. The trade off however is that there is larger audio signal
                                    distortion.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The next thing I did was separate the input control (volume and aux) from the
                                    amplifier and screen driver board. This also helped mitigate some noise as well as
                                    aid in the debugging process and made everything easier to integrate in the end. I
                                    added a breakout for 5V and all the audio channels (left, right, and mixed)
                                </p>

                                    This was also a continuation of my previous weeks assignments (input devices). In
                                    this version however I made the board simpler and modularized it. Again for
                                    debugging reasons.
                                </p>

                                    This is the only thing on the ATV I regret to say did not fully work. During
                                    debugging I discovered that the 5V regulator on board was outputting 9V and fried
                                    the MCU. At that point it was too late to do anything about it. So I cut my losses
                                    with screen. I attached my code and for the board and also have a video of the
                                    circuit working on a breadboard in <a href="./week-9-details.html">week-9</a>. It is
                                    worth noting that this was inadvertently a good thing as it turned out much the low
                                    audio quality in the previous week was due to LED matrix screen.

                                This project could not have been completed without the support of the HTM staff and
                                Neil's support. Special thanks to Anthony for the times he helped me debug Audio
                                problems. We would also like to thank Jack and Dan from D-lab for putting up with us
                                during this project. D-lab became a second home to me during this project and Jack a
                                great mentor. Thanks to all the other students in HTM for a great semester.
